                skeletal and motor system, peripheral nerves, blood vessels,
                fat, or the walls of various organs.
                <br />
                The prevalence of sarcomas is generally 1% of all malignant
                tumors. <br />
                Soft tissue sarcoma can arise in practically any organ of the
                body, such as: the limbs, and internal organs such as the
                stomach, intestines, kidneys, lungs, breast, urinary tract,
                reproductive system, abdominal wall, chest, and back.
                <br />
                <br />
                The most prominent types of soft tissue sarcoma There are
                several types of soft tissue sarcoma depending on the soft
                tissues from which the tumor was formed, most notably:
                Liposarcoma: originates in adipose tissue.
                <br />
                Angiosarcoma: develops from blood vessels.
                <br />
                <br />
                Rhabdomyosarcoma: Sarcoma, which comes from skeletal muscles, is
                the most common sarcoma in children.
                <br /> Sarcomas are common in children and adults, and in adults
                common sarcomas are those that come from fat, nerves, blood
                vessels, muscle envelope, and connective tissue. <br />
                The average time between the onset of sarcoma symptoms in a limb
                until a diagnosis is determined is three to six months. <br />
                In any case of suspicion of soft tissue sarcoma, a specialist
                sarcoma oncology team working in a joint unit combining
                orthopedics and oncology should be contacted.
                <br />
                <br /> The staff includes a sarcoma oncologist, an orthopedic
                surgeon specializing in musculoskeletal tumors, a surgeon
                specializing in internal tumor resection, a pathologist
                (Pathologist), a radiologist, an anesthesiologist and pain
                therapist, a physiotherapist and a nurse.

              <h3 className="mb-3">Symptoms of soft tissue sarcoma</h3>
              At the beginning of the disease, the size of the tumor may not be
              sufficient to reach the nerves and the appearance of symptoms, but
              as the disease progresses, symptoms occur.
              <br /> Symptoms occur after the mass grows at the site of cancer,
              and the symptoms vary according to the location of the disease as
              follows: Symptoms of a lump in the abdomen:
              <br /> This causes abdominal pain, a feeling of fullness, and
              constipation.
              <br /> Symptoms of a lump in the lung: This causes
              coughing,shortness of breath.
              <br /> Causes and risk factors of soft tissue sarcoma There are
              many causes and factors for soft tissue sarcoma, which are as
              follows:
              <br />
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Causes of soft tissue sarcoma The causes of soft tissue
                  sarcoma are unclear, but in general, soft tissue sarcoma is
                  caused by a genetic mutation that causes abnormal cell growth
                  and accumulation until a tumor form.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Risk factors There are several factors that increase the risk
                  of soft tissue sarcoma:
                  <br /> Genetic factor The chances of soft tissue sarcoma
                  increase when there is a family genetic history of infection
                  or the presence of familial genetic diseases, such as:
                  neurofibromatosis, Gardner syndrome, colonpolyps, and chronic
                  swelling of the limbs.
                </li>
              </ol>
              Exposure to chemicals Exposure to certain chemicals, such as
              pesticides and arsenic, may increase the risk of soft tissue
              sarcoma.
              <br /> Radiation exposure Previous radiation therapy for other
              cancers can increase the risk of soft tissue sarcoma.
              <br /> Aging The disease occurs at all ages, but it is more common
              in middle age and adults, so advancing age is a factor that
              increases the risk of this type of tumor.

              The most prominent complications of soft tissue sarcoma are:
              <br />
              Cancer has spread to other areas of the body. Catching the
              infection due to weakened immunity that occurs as a complication
              related to the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Diagnosis of soft
              tissue sarcoma If the doctor suspects the presence of soft tissue
              sarcoma, the doctor will perform the following tests: <br />
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Physical examination The doctor makes a close look at all the
                  lumps in the body.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Imaging examinations To assess the area containing sarcoma,
                  the following tests are performed: Ultrasonography: Abdominal
                  imaging is often done in this method. MRI: This imaging is
                  performed on the arms and legs. X-ray imaging: This method may
                  sometimes be used.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Biopsy In some cases, the doctor may resort to taking a biopsy
                  of the mass to look at it and examine it under a microscope,
                  often the sample is taken using a fine needle, but in some
                  cases the biopsy may require a minor operation.

              <h3 className="mb-3">Treatment of soft tissue sarcoma</h3>
              Soft tissue sarcoma is treated depending on the size, type, and
              location of the tumor, but in general treatment is done using the
              following methods:
              <br />
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Perform surgery Surgery is a common way to treat soft tissue
                  sarcoma, which is used if the disease is detected early, often
                  through which the tumor and part of the surrounding cells are
                  removed to ensure that all cancer cells are eliminated.
                  Efforts are made to minimize the impact of surgery on the
                  appearance and function of the affected part of the body, but
                  there is a possibility that the patient will have some
                  difficulty using the affected part of the body after surgery,
                  and sometimes another surgery may be needed to repair it. In
                  cases of sarcoma in the limbs, such as: legs and arms, it is
                  preferable to resort to radiation therapy, or chemotherapy to
                  reduce the size of the tumor and avoid the need for
                  amputation, but in some cases surgery is necessary and
                  amputation is unfortunately the only appropriate option.

                  Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is used through the use of
                  high-energy beams, and it is used in one of the following
                  ways: Before surgery: Preoperative radiation therapy is used
                  to shrink the tumor and facilitate its removal. During
                  surgery: Radiation during surgery allows a higher dose to be
                  delivered directly to the target area, avoiding access to
                  surrounding tissue. After surgery: Radiation therapy after
                  surgery helps kill and get rid of any remaining cancer cells
                  after the procedure. Treatment without resorting to surgery:
                  It is used to relieve symptoms, and not to worsen the disease
                  if surgery is not possible. There are many side effects of
                  radiation therapy, most notably: dermatitis, fatigue, and hair
                  loss. The purposes are often temporary and the patient
                  improves within a few days or weeks of the end of radiation
                  therapy.

                <br />
                <li>
                  Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells, and
                  chemotherapy may be oral, or intravenously, often chemotherapy
                  is used intravenously before the operation to shrink the tumor
                  and facilitate the possibility of its removal. Chemotherapy is
                  also used alone, or in combination with radiation therapy if
                  surgical intervention is not possible. After soft tissue
                  sarcoma types respond to chemotherapy more than others, and
                  chemotherapy is often used in rhabdomyosis. Side effects of
                  chemotherapy include: Feeling of permanent fatigue. Feeling
                  sick. Hair loss. Symptoms may be tiring but temporary and
                  don't last forever.

                  Targeted drug therapy Some types of soft tissue sarcoma have
                  specific characteristics in their cells that can be attacked
                  by targeted drug therapies, these drugs work better than
                  chemotherapy and are almost non-toxic. These targeted
                  therapies are particularly useful in gastrointestinal stromal
                  tumors.
